### Inspiration
Challenged by THG to reimagine e-commerce, we birthed Cosmic Coutureâ€”an immersive space-themed platform. Swipe right to curate your basket with stellar items, left to transcend mundane choices.

###Â What it does
Cosmic Couture blends HTML, CSS, and JS for a visually striking frontend, while the backend orbits on the power of Go. A seamless swipe interface redefines how users engage with their shopping journey.

###Â Challenges we ran into
Ambitious plans for a machine learning recommendation system faced limitations due to a modest dataset. Undeterred, we pivoted to crafting an exceptional home page experience.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Behold the triumph of our home pageâ€”a seamless convergence of design and functionality.

###Â What we learned
Embarking on this odyssey, we discovered the awe-inspiring capabilities of ChatGPT, even outshining our coding prowess! ðŸ˜‚

###Â What's next for Cosmic Couture
As we bask in the glow of accomplishment, our cosmic journey continues. Next stop: a well-deserved voyage into the realm of rest. Sweet dreams await! ðŸŒŒâœ¨ #CosmicCouture #InnovationUnveiled
